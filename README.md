Introduction:  
The Hill Cipher is a classical encryption algorithm developed by the mathematician Lester S. Hill in 1929. It is one of the earliest examples of a polygraphic substitution cipher, which means that it operates on multiple letters at a time, making it more resistant to frequency analysis than simple substitution ciphers like the Caesar cipher.

Overview:
The Hill cipher encrypts blocks of text by treating the message as vectors of numbers and applying linear algebraic transformations using matrix multiplication. It is based on modular arithmetic, where the letters of the alphabet are represented by numbers (A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25). A square matrix, known as the key matrix, is used to transform the plaintext vectors into ciphertext.
